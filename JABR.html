                        <a href="https://game-dev-hu-22.itch.io/jabr">Just Another Boss Rush</a> was a game made in Godot for my game development class. 
                        This project was my first time working in Godot. 
                        Just as the name implies this is a boss rush style game where the player fights a series of bosses in order to increase high scores.

                    <p>
                        The state machine was an interesting challenge since it was the part of the game that had to work with other scenes/levels and switch between each one when the player has defeated a boss. 
                        This was especially the case when it came to restarting the game when the player beat it because we needed a way to delete the previous scores, times, and level scenes. 
                        At first, I thought I could just set the current scene back to the first scene in the scene history, but we would run into an issue where the game levels would appear in the correct sequence but, some transitions would be out of order. 
                        Also, the score and time in each full playthrough increased from when it was last played. 
                        To fix this bug, I instead cleared the scene history and loaded the levels the same way they were loaded at the start of the game.
                    </p>
                    
                    
                    
                    <h2>Transitions and Game Over Screen</h2>
                    
                    
                    
                    <figure>

                    </figure>
                    
                    
                    <p>
                        Some other tasks that needed to be completed for the game were a visual transition between levels and a game-over screen. 
                        The transition screen is a simple animation that changes a gradient of the transition layer from black to transparent and vice versa.
                    </p>
                    
                    
                    
                    <figure>
                        <img src="images/JABR-gameover-2.png" alt="">
                        <figcaption>Game Over Screen Code Snippet</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    
                    
                    <p>
                        The game-over screen needed to implement the playerâ€™s score from each level. 
                        Above is how I calculated player scores and collected their health and level completion time. 
                        The state machine would keep track of all the level scores and times so it could display the total score at the end of the game.
