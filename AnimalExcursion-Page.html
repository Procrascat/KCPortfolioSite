                    <p><a href="https://www.vrtality.org/resources/vr-experiences/">Animal Excursion</a> is a VR experience worked on by a team of interns I was on with the Seattle Public Library. The VR experience was developed in Unity using C# and aimed to support teen mental health through co-designing. The three-person development team(1 lead and 2 interns) codesigned the experience with teens from the Fayette Library design this experience. This resulted in a VR experience set in a forest environment where the player can pet and feed animals. Development for this project lasted about 3 months (Nov. – Jan.) and my role in this project was to develop the AI and player interactions for the animals. </p>
                    
                    
                    
                    <h2>Animal Behavior</h2>
                    
                    
                    
                    <p>The animal AI, needed to be able to move in the game world independent of the player, while also moving to the player and stopping when triggered. To do this, I used the Unity Navmesh components for the animal’s pathfinding and scripting for its behaviors. </p>

                    <p>The photo above shows one of the animals that are in the experience, the goat. The goat uses a game object I made that consists of a nav mesh agent component and two colliders for seeing and eating. This allowed the goat to move around its environment. C# scripts are used to activate the animal’s ability to walk.</p>
                    
                    
                    
                  
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    <h2>Player Interactions with Animals</h2>
                    
                    
                    
                    <p>The codesigners felt that being able to interact with animals would add to the mental health aspect of the experience. So the player needed to be able to interact with the animals consistently. This meant making interactions to allow the player to pet animals and feed them.</p>
                    
                    
                    
                    <figure><img src="images/bear-petting.webp" alt="">

                    </figure>
                    
                    
                    
                    <p>To give the players the feeling of interacting with animals, the animal agents have eyes and mouth colliders that allow the animal to “locate” and “eat” food. When an animal’s specified favorite food has entered the eye collider, the behavior script takes the location of the food and sets that location as a target for the food. When the food collides with the mouth collider, the animal will then remove that object from the scene because it is considered eaten. This interaction is how the player establishes ownership of the animals which leads to the following behavior described previously. </p>
                    
                    
                    
                    <p>Petting animals proved to be a challenge. While I could child/connect the animal’s head to the player’s hand, at a certain range there was still an issue of the head not returning to its normal orientation. The project’s lead suggested I use a quaternion for having the rotation change from the rotation tied to the player’s hand to the animal’s original head rotation. This made it so that the animal’s heads wouldn’t remain at an awkward angle after being petted. </p>
