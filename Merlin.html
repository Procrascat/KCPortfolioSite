                <a href="https://realworldstudio.itch.io/merlin">Merlin</a> is a top-down RPG game created by Solomon Lucas-Thornton, set in a fantasy world where the player must fight bosses and collect spells used to defeat enemies. 
                The game was developed in Godot using GDScript.

                When I joined the project, I started off by fixing a bug where the enemies’ attacks on the player would stop registering after the first hit. 
                After playtesting, I found that the enemy’s attack function was triggered only when the player’s hitbox entered its hurt box instead of every frame it was there.

            <p>
                When I was working on the cutscene team, we needed a key NPC to appear at multiple parts of the game who would direct the player to where they should go. So I was tasked with creating the NPC object that would trigger the NPC and effects to appear. 
                For this, I made use of the collision triggers so that when the player was close enough the character would appear with his sparkle effects.
